# what is going on here? can you explain the output?

tup = 'Hello'
print(len(tup))

# It is printing the number of characters inside 'tup'. Hello has 5 characters.

tup = 'Hello',
print(len(tup))

# the trailing comma after 'hello' has made 'tup' variable into a tuple
# so the 'len' function is just counting the single item
